Building Command-Line Utilities in Python
#########################################

    "Arguably, Python is the best language for making UNIX\ :sup:`Â®` command line
    tools, period, due to its batteries-included philosophy, and its
    emphasis on readable code. Just a warning, though; these are dangerous
    ideas when you find out how easy it is to create a command line tool in
    Python, you might be spoiled for life." [Gift08]_

.. code::

    @command()
    def hello():
        print('You might be spoiled for life!')

.. hint::

    A function becomes a command line tool by decorating it with
    **@command**. At its simplest, just decorating a function with this
    decorator will make it into a callable script. [Rona17]_

Choose Your Preferred Learning Style

1. Just show me the code! 
2. I want to design better command-line utilities.
3. I want to watch Click eat its own dog food.
4. I'm coming from the world of argparse.
5. I'm coming from the world of docopts.
6. I just want a cheatsheet & reference material.
